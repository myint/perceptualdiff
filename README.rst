Usage
=====

Command line::

    Usage: peceptualdiff image1 image2

    Compares image1 and image2 using a perceptually based image metric.

    Options:
      --verbose        Turn on verbose mode
      --fov deg        Field of view in degrees [0.1, 89.9] (default: 45.0)
      --threshold p    Number of pixels p below which differences are ignored
      --gamma g        Value to convert rgb into linear space (default: 2.2)
      --luminance l    White luminance (default: 100.0 cdm^-2)
      --luminanceonly  Only consider luminance; ignore chroma (color) in the
                       comparison
      --colorfactor    How much of color to use [0.0, 1.0] (default: 1.0)
      --downsample     How many powers of two to down sample the image
                       (default: 0)
      --scale          Scale images to match each other's dimensions
      --sum-errors     Print a sum of the luminance and color differences
      --output o       Write difference to the file o

Version History
===============

- 1.0 - Initial distribution
- 1.0.1 - Fixed off by one convolution error and libpng interface to 1.2.8
- 1.0.2 - [jt] Converted the loading and saving routines to use FreeImage
- 1.1 - Added colorfactor and downsample options. Also always output
  difference file if requested. Always print out differing pixels even if the
  test passes.
- 1.1.1 - Turn off color test in low lighting conditions.
- 1.1.2 - Add OpenMP parallel processing support and fix bugs.
- 1.2 - Add ``--sum-errors``, use more standard option style, and fix bugs.
